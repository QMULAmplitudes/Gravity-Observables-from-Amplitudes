The contents are: 

tree_level_5_point.m    -File containing the tree-level 5 point HEFT amplitude with 4 scalars and 1 outgoing gravitons,
tree_level_6_point.m    -File containing the tree-level 6 point HEFT amplitude with 4 scalars and 2 outgoing gravitons,
one_loop_5_point.wl     -File containing the 1-loop 5 point HEFT amplitude with 4 scalars and 1 outgoing graviton,
loading_results.nb	-Notebook where all the amplitudes can be loaded and the notation is explained.
1_loop_5_points_ex.nb	-Explanatory notebook for the 5 point  1-loop amplitude.


NOTE!!:
   - What we denote in one_loop_5_point.wl as lw1 is different from the main text in eq. (7.1) and it is simply the coefficient of log (1/\mu_IR^2). 
  - The definitions of the integrals I1 and I2  in one_loop_5_point.wl differ from those in the main text in eq. (6.4) by a factor of (1/2). The coefficients c1 and c2 also change by a factor of 2 so that complete expression for the amplitude is the same here and in the paper.
